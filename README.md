# AgriGrow Sense

**Affordable precision soil scanning — for gardens, fields, and farms.**

---

## Overview

Precision agriculture is reshaping how we grow food, but the tools to support it are often out of reach for gardeners, smallholders, and independent farmers. High-end soil scanners from companies like **Isaria Scout**, **Topcon CropSpec**, and **Trimble GreenSeeker** typically cost anywhere from **$1,000 to $7,000+**, making them inaccessible for most people.

**AgriGrow Sense** was created to change that. It's a DIY handheld soil scanner that offers real, science-based soil measurements for around **$150 CAD**, without cutting corners. Built from a passion for gardening and a future goal of opening my own farm, AgriGrow Sense aims to make soil health tools affordable and available to everyone.

## Why Precision Agriculture Matters

Good farming decisions start with good data. Precision agriculture helps growers:

- **Use less fertilizer and chemicals**, saving money and reducing environmental impact.
- **Adapt to microclimates and soil differences**, improving plant health.
- **Increase yields and crop quality** with targeted interventions.
- **Support sustainability** by protecting long-term soil health.
- **Make smarter, more confident choices**, no matter the size of the operation.

Tools like AgriGrow Sense help bring these benefits to gardens, small farms, and larger fields alike.

## The Problem

Getting reliable soil data isn't easy for everyday growers:

| Option | Problem |
|:-------|:--------|
| Cheap $15–$30 "4-in-1" soil meters | Poor accuracy, no real calibration |
| Mid-range testers (Bluelab, Extech, Hanna Instruments) — $150–$400 | Only measure pH and EC; no GPS, light, or UV sensing |
| Pro-grade scanners (Isaria Scout, CropSpec, GreenSeeker) — $5,000–$7,000+ | High-end, but expensive and focused mainly on canopy analysis |

AgriGrow Sense fills the gap, giving growers real multi-sensor soil insights at a practical price.

## Target Audience

AgriGrow Sense is designed for:

- **Gardeners** growing in small spaces
- **Urban farmers** working with raised beds and rooftop gardens
- **Homesteaders and smallholders** managing 1–10 acres
- **Farmers** handling larger fields who need affordable spot-checking tools

No matter the scale, healthy soil is the foundation of success.

## Features

- **Soil pH Measurement** — Detects soil acidity or alkalinity through soil slurry samples.
- **Soil Fertility (EC/TDS) Measurement** — Estimates nutrient levels for smarter fertilization.
- **Moisture Sensing** — Monitors soil water content to fine-tune irrigation.
- **Soil Temperature Monitoring** — Tracks soil temperature for planting and growth optimization.
- **Soil Color Classification** — Uses color data to help identify soil types and organic matter levels.
- **Visible/Infrared Light Spectrum Sensing** — Gathers light data to evaluate environmental conditions.
- **UV Exposure Detection** — Measures ultraviolet light intensity in the field.
- **GPS Mapping** — Records the exact location of each soil sample.
- **Live OLED Display** — Shows real-time sensor readings in the field.
- **USB/Bluetooth Serial Data Logging** — Exports full datasets to a computer for analysis and archiving.
- **Soil Health Recommendations** — Suggests basic improvements (e.g., lime for acidic soil, water for dry zones).
- **Sample Mapping and Archiving** — Builds a GPS-tagged record of soil conditions across a field.
- **Modular Expandable Design** — Easily add new sensors or features in the future.

## Calibration Process

Calibration is essential for reliable soil measurements:

- **pH Calibration**: Using standard buffer solutions (pH 4.0, 6.86, 9.18) to set accurate pH readings.
- **TDS Calibration**: Adjusting based on known-concentration nutrient solutions.
- **Moisture Calibration**: Testing moisture sensor behavior across dry, moist, and saturated soils.

These methods match industry standard practices used in agricultural science.

---

## Accuracy Improvement and Testing Goals

While AgriGrow Sense is manually calibrated to a high standard, reaching professional grade accuracy requires independent testing. Future plans include:

- Working with **agronomists, researchers, and soil experts**.
- Seeking **formal validation** from organizations like the **University of Guelph**.
- Comparing AgriGrow Sense to lab-grade soil analysis equipment.

The goal is to continuously refine accuracy and reliability based on real-world testing.

## Competitive Analysis

| Device | Price | Key Features | Limitations |
|:-------|:------|:-------------|:------------|
| Cheap 4-in-1 Soil Meters | $15–30 | Basic moisture and pH readings | Inaccurate, no calibration |
| Bluelab/Extech/Hanna Instruments | $150–400 | pH, EC testing | No GPS, light, or UV data |
| Isaria Scout / CropSpec / GreenSeeker | $5,000–7,000+ | NDVI crop canopy scanning | No deep soil sensing, extremely high cost |
| **AgriGrow Sense** | ~$150 | pH, EC, Moisture, Temp, UV, Color, GPS, Light sensing | Soil-focused; no NDVI canopy scan (yet) |
